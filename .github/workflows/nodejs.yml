# As a project grows, the time it takes to run the lint, test, and build will all increase.
# Separate jobs for each allow these to run in parallel, reducing the overall run time.
# There's some overhead for the repetition of the shared steps.
# For public Github repositories where build time is free, this overhead is inconsequential.
# For private repositories, this will slightly increase build minutes used.
# So, for large private repositories, you may want to switch to self-hosted action runners.
